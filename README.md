Lessons Learned

I started on this project Friday night as I knew it would likely take considerable time.  I came prepared to TA hours and felt like I made good progress; however, a stomach bug has hit our house this weekend with me having to take care of our smallest children.  I have code and am currently chasing down why I am receiving database errors and not returning information about my films.  Hoping that I can get it completed prior to start; however, I may be seeking an extension if permitted.
